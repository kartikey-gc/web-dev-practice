              <h2>About School</h2>
              <p>

                The A.M. Naik School, set up by the Naik Charitable Trust in the L&T Campus in Powai, Mumbai, is devoted to transforming lives through the power of education. Students stepping into our institutions will embark on a journey of exploration and discovery – of the universe around them and more importantly the world within.
                
                It is said that teaching is the art of assisted discovery. Our team of experienced facilitators will help your child realize his or her true potential. The school will open its doors to its first batch of students from Nursery to Grade 8 on June 9th, 2022.
                
                Classes will be progressively extended up to Grade 12 (ISC), with all three streams, viz., Science, Commerce, and Humanities.

                                          <p>Our school has been designed keeping the BaLA Technique – Building as Learning Aid concept in mind, at the core, it assumes that the architecture of school can be a resource for the teaching learning processes. BaLA is about developing the school’s entire physical environment as a learning aid – the inside, the outside, the semi-open spaces – everywhere. At the core, it is about maximizing the educational ‘value’ of a built space. It is based on ‘how students learn’.</p>
